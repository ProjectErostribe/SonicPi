# SonicPi
I made this repo to hold my Sonic Pi tutorial code, and would like to use this ReadMe to hold my notes.

Here is the first Twitch stream where I came across Sonic Pi [Makind Code Sing with Sonic Pi](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/897274844?filter=all&sort=time).

In looking for more information, I came across this Twitch stream with the creator of Sonic Pi: [Live Coding Music with the Creator of Sonic Pi, Sam Adams](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/894247604?filter=all&sort=time).
